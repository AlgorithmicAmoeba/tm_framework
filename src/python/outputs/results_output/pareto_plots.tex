\caption{Pareto frontier analysis for metric pairs showing optimal trade-offs between different evaluation criteria. Black circles connected by dashed lines represent Pareto optimal models that are not dominated by any other model across both metrics. Gray crosses show non-Pareto optimal models. Top-left: NPMI vs WEPS coherence measures. Top-right: NPMI vs WECS coherence measures. Bottom-left: WEPS vs ISH (topic diversity). Bottom-right: WECS vs ISH (topic diversity).}
